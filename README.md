# Are we what we tweet?
How many people are having a burger? How often do they go to a healthy restaurant? 
Who is sitting on the couch watching TV and who is exercising? 
Twitter generates an enormous amount of behavioral data. But can this data be representative for the population? 
<br>
In this project, I scraped tweets based on 200 queries representing either a healthy or an unhealthy behavior. Using the user's location
the tweets were associated with US States and counted. Based on the counts and features derived from those counts I tried to predict obesity and other health indicators.
